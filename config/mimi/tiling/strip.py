"""Scrollable strip, the way niri tiles.

Windows sit in columns on a strip that is wider than the display. The
display is a viewport onto it: focusing a window scrolls the strip until its
column is fully in view. A column that overlaps the viewport is shown at its
place on the strip, cut at the edge if it does not fit, so a neighbour of a
column wider than half stays partly in sight. The ones wholly beyond the
edges are parked there with a sliver peeking in, enough to reach with the
focus command. Nothing is ever squeezed to fit; a new column keeps its width
and the strip gets longer.

Commands the layout answers (mimi gives them no meaning; this file does):

  mimi tiling cmd focus <left|right>    focus the next column that way,
                                        scrolling to it; up/down within one
  mimi tiling cmd move <left|right>     move the focused column along the strip
  mimi tiling cmd consume                pull the focused window into the column
                                         on its left, stacked below
  mimi tiling cmd expel                  push the focused window out into a
                                         column of its own, to the right
  mimi tiling cmd width [fraction|prev|+d|-d]
                                        cycle the focused column through a
                                        third, a half, two thirds (prev goes
                                        back); set a fraction; or nudge it by
                                        d, as niri's +10%
  mimi tiling cmd center                 scroll the focused column to the middle
  mimi tiling cmd togglefloat            take the focused window off the strip
                                        and leave it where it is, or put it
                                        back in a column of its own
  mimi tiling cmd scroll <left|right> [fraction]
                                        scroll the strip a step that way, a
                                        quarter of the display unless given
  mimi tiling cmd togglemax              fill the display with the focused
                                         window, for now

With tiling.relayout_on_drag set, dragging a column's edge sets its width,
and dropping a window on another column moves it into that column. Use the
focus command rather than mimi action focus_window --left/--right: the
parked columns all sit at the edge, so spatial focus cannot tell them apart.

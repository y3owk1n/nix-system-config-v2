"""Dwindle BSP, the way Hyprland tiles by default.

Every window is a leaf of a binary tree. A new window splits the focused
window's area in two, side by side when that area is wider than tall and
stacked otherwise; closing a window hands its area back to its sibling.
The tree lives in the state mimi keeps for the space, so nothing here
touches a file.

Commands the layout answers (mimi gives them no meaning; this file does):

  mimi tiling cmd swap <left|right|up|down>   swap with the neighbour that way
  mimi tiling cmd togglesplit                 flip the focused window's split
  mimi tiling cmd ratio <delta>               grow (+) or shrink (-) the focused
                                              window's share of its split
  mimi tiling cmd togglefloat                 take the focused window out of the
                                              tree, or put it back
  mimi tiling cmd togglemax                   fill the area with the focused
                                              window, for now

With tiling.relayout_on_drag set, dragging any edge of any window resizes the
split that edge belongs to, and the rest of the tree follows; dragging a
window and dropping it on another swaps the two, as Hyprland does.

A layout program: reads the tiling input on stdin, prints the output on
stdout. Copy, edit, own. Standard library only.

Usage: bsp.py     (the gap is tiling.gap, else the macOS tiled-window margin)

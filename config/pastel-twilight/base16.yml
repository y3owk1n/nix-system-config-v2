# Backgrounds (base00–base02):
#   A deep muted violet (#1f1d2e) sets the canvas, evoking twilight just after sunset.
#   Dimmer layers (#2a2738, #3a364d) add depth without harshness, like fading silhouettes on the horizon.
#
# Midtones & Foregrounds (base03–base07):
#   Soft lavender-grays replace sterile neutrals, keeping the palette gentle and human.
#   The midtone (#9a96b5) brightens the haze, bridging the backgrounds and text.
#   Foreground text (#e0def4) glows like moonlight—clear yet calm—while highlights (#faf7ff) shimmer as soft paper white instead of stark brilliance.
#
# Accents (base08–base0F):
#   Accents lean into pastel shades, like watercolor washes across the night sky.
#     Red (#f28fad) is a tender blush, warmth at the edge of sunset.
#     Orange/Yellow (#f8bd96, #f9e2af) glow like lanterns and fireflies in the dusk.
#     Green/Cyan (#abe9b3, #b5e8e0) bring renewal and serenity, like growth and flowing rivers.
#     Blue (#80b8e8) deepens into a contemplative evening sky.
#     Purple (#c9a0e9) lingers as a dreamy, duskier violet.
#     Mauve (#d4a4b8) whispers of fading petals, reserved for rare and special highlights.
